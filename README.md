# Grab GST STATUS from Lookup GST Status page on Customs

This is still experimenting...

1. You need to have phantomjs install (not covered here)
2. Run the script by invoke the phantomjs command in command line (cmd)

  phantomjs gstcustoms2.js
  
3. And it only browse through from get.customs mainpage into lookup status page.
4. And click the radio option
5. And screen capture
